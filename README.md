# Police Brutality

---

This analysis is an attempt to express a correlation of the police's effectiveness (or much rather ineffectiveness) amongst given racially and or ethnically Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Asian communities in Indianapolis, Indiana. Upon viewing the available datasets, my hypothesis is that there is a correlation between the number of complaints filed by BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) residents, allegation, and the use of execissive force. Through historical context given light in the most recent historical moment for the Black Lives Matter movement, a premisses is ensued by the knowing and understanding that cops are not meant to "Serve and Protect" as their oath states, but rather to withhold the imperialistic standards that is strongly and eruditely withheld in the present.
