# Police_Brutality
This analysis is an attempt to express a correlation of the police's effectiveness amongst given racial and or ethnical communities in Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and or Asian. My hypothesis is that this analysis may show more skewed data via reported higher crime rates in poorer, under-represented communities in comparison to white counterparts' community as their seems to be a higher tendency to have a higher median income and more privileges than others.
