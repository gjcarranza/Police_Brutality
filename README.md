# Police Brutality

---

This analysis is an attempt to express a correlation of the police's effectiveness amongst given racially and or ethnically Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Asian communities in Indianapolis, Indiana. Upon viewing the available datasets, my hypothesis is that there is a strong correlation between number of calls in poorer communities, and a strong correlation between number of calls and filed complaints.
